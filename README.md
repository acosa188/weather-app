# Weather App
A web application that tracks weather conditions in your current location.
It makes it easy to know the weather details without any user interaction. With just a simple visit to the website, the weather information is ready for display. It has some css animations base on the current weather condition, be it snow, cloudy, and sunny.

It uses API like *api.ipgeolocation.io* to know the user's location, then passes that parameter to API *api.openweathermap.org* to retrieve weather condition details.
The application also dynamically changes its background images base on weather conditions, time, and orientation (landscape or portrait). I made sure to credit each artist below. If you like any art
they made, make sure to watch them. I will link each artist below.
